 orbits_test_tides_wh.txt - first successful run with tides for a test planet with a=0.057217,mp=0.000030,rp=0.018300,Qp=0.010000, star: Rs=1.000000, Ms=1.000000. Completed with no errors, and the tidal forces are pretty close (but not exactly) to the theoretical prediction.

orbits_test_tides_noda - the ‘da’ part of the tide is turned off, but still getting the deviation. WHYYYYYY??!!!??!!

orbits_de_noda - outputting various quantities like de, a, GM5a5, Rp5a5 over time, to track the evolution of these variables over time. ‘a’ has occasional but very chaotic changes. 

orbits_nodeda - no de or da effect of tides, but still doing the cartesian->orbital->cartesian. Had an (a_new - a_old > 6.5e-14) stop condition, but never happened. So the variations are small, but seem to be consistently rising.
