 orbits_test_tides_wh.txt - first successful run with tides for a test planet with a=0.057217,mp=0.000030,rp=0.018300,Qp=0.010000, star: Rs=1.000000, Ms=1.000000. Completed with no errors, and the tidal forces are pretty close (but not exactly) to the theoretical prediction.

orbits_test_tides_noda - the ‘da’ part of the tide is turned off, but still getting the deviation. WHYYYYYY??!!!??!!
