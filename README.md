tides
=====

Code containing migration, tides for integrating a solar system.

Notes: If you want to run more than one simulation on the same system, you need to create multiple executibles (i.e. multiple nbody files). To do this, need to edit both the tides/Makefile and src/Makefile, and change ./nbody to e.g. ./nbody2, ‘make’ and then run ./nbody2.
